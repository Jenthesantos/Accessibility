<Accessibility>

## Description
The reason this project was made was to create a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that the site is optimized for search engines. The problems solved included: adding structure to the html and changing div tags to make it easier to follow the structure of the html. I learnt to be cautious of how changing tags can change the outcome of CSS and in turn change the desired outcome of the webpage
